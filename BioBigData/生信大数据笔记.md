Workflow of NGS 二代测序流程

1. Sample fragmentation
2. Library preparation
3. Clonal Amplification
4. Sequencing reaction
5. Data analysis

Principle of SMRT

1. Millions of zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs), embedded with only one set of enzymes and DNA template that can be detected during the whole process.
2. During the reaction, the enzyme will incorporate the nucleotide into the complementary strand and cleave off the fluorescent dye previously linked with nucleotide.
3. The camera inside the machine will capture signal in a movie format in real-time observation.

## 基因组测序方式与质量控制

### 测序方法简介

**3种测序方法**

- Single read 单端测序
- Paired-end read 双端测序
- Mate-pair read 配对测序


#### Single-read library

1. DNA sample is digested into 200-500bp fragments.
2. Primer and adaptors are ligated to the ends of fragments, respectively.
3. DNA fragments are linked to flow cell to generate DNA cluster (spots on flow cell of same sequences made by amplification).
4. Sequencing.




#### Paired-end library

1. Genomic DNA
2. Fragment DNA into 200-500bp.
3. Add adapter and primers in both ends of the sequence of interest.
4. Generate **clusters**.
5. Sequencing step - using modified dNTPs (ddNTPs) and primers for know sequences you read the reads by light signals.



#### Mate-pair library

1. Sequence fragmentation is made in bigger fragments (2-5 kb).

2. A addition of a Biotin in each 5' ends is done.

3. The sequence with correct addition of Biotin will circularize and after a wash, the sequencing with non-circularized fragment will be thrown away.

4. The circularized fragments will be cut with the biotin in the middle and size-selected (400-600 bp).

5. Sequencing is done normally: adapter with primer sequence addition, the fragments will be spotted and clustered, and sequencing.
