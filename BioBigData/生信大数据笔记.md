##基因组测序技术

Workflow of NGS 二代测序流程

1. Sample fragmentation
2. Library preparation
3. Clonal Amplification
4. Sequencing reaction
5. Data analysis

Principle of SMRT

1. Millions of zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs), embedded with only one set of enzymes and DNA template that can be detected during the whole process.
2. During the reaction, the enzyme will incorporate the nucleotide into the complementary strand and cleave off the fluorescent dye previously linked with nucleotide.
3. The camera inside the machine will capture signal in a movie format in real-time observation.

## 基因组测序方式与质量控制

### 测序方法简介

**3种测序方法**

- Single read 单端测序
- Paired-end read 双端测序
- Mate-pair read 配对测序


#### Single-read library

1. DNA sample is digested into 200-500bp fragments.
2. Primer
