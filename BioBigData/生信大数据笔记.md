Workflow of NGS 二代测序流程

1. Sample fragmentation
2. Library preparation
3. Clonal Amplification
4. Sequencing reaction
5. Data analysis

Principle of SMRT

1. Millions of zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs), embedded with only one set of enzymes and DNA template that can be detected during the whole process.
2. During the reaction, the enzyme will incorporate the nucleotide into the complementary strand and cleave off the fluorescent dye previously linked with nucleotide.
3. The camera inside the machine will capture signal in a movie format in real-time observation.

## 基因组测序方式与质量控制

### 测序方法简介

**3种测序方法**

- Single read 单端测序
- Paired-end read 双端测序
- Mate-pair read 配对测序


#### Single-read library

1. DNA sample is digested into 200-500bp fragments.
2. Primer and adaptors are ligated to the ends of fragments, respectively.
3. DNA fragments are linked to flow cell to generate DNA cluster (spots on flow cell of same sequences made by amplification).
4. Sequencing.




#### Paired-end library

1. Genomic DNA
2. Fragment DNA into 200-500bp.
3. Add adapter and primers in both ends of the sequence of interest.
4. Generate **clusters**.
5. Sequencing step - using modified dNTPs (ddNTPs) and primers for know sequences you read the reads by light signals.



#### Mate-pair library

1. Sequence fragmentation is made in bigger fragments (2-5 kb).

2. A addition of a Biotin in each 5' ends is done.

3. The sequence with correct addition of Biotin will circularize and after a wash, the sequencing with non-circularized fragment will be thrown away.

4. The circularized fragments will be cut with the biotin in the middle and size-selected (400-600 bp).

5. Sequencing is done normally: adapter with primer sequence addition, the fragments will be spotted and clustered, and sequencing.

参考学习下<http://www.cnblogs.com/huangshujia/p/3233693.html>，这是非常不错的讲解。

**Summary:**

1. 样本建库不同；
2. Single Read (SR) 只检测待测片段的 一端序列信息，PE或MP检测待测片段的两端序列信息；
3. 信息具有互补性。



### Sequencing read file format

#### Sequencing read file in Fasta format

第一行为描述行，以`>`开头，然后接序列信息

第二行是标准的单字母序列，有时加`*`号作为结束符

两个序列之间以空行分隔

- Reads are often stored in fasta files
- Separate file for forward and reverse pairs
- header line -- read name/pairing info
- sequence line -- nucleotides

#### Sequencing read file in Fastq format

1. Line 1 begins with a '@' character and if followed by a sequence identifier and an optional description.

2. Line 2 is the raw sequence letters.

3. Line 3 begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same identifier (and any description) again.

4. Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in Line 2, and must contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence.

   ​	The character '!' represents the lowest quality while '~' is the highest.

   ​



Most read are stored in fastq, 4 lines per read.



### Read quality control

Raw reads are always in fastq format. Usually, Quality score (Q-score) of a raw reads is used to measure the confidence in the base calling's identity.
$$
Q_{score} = - 10 * log_{10}P (P为碱基识别出错的概率)
$$
The higher $Q_{score}$, the lower $P_{error}$.

Tools could be used to check Q-score for raw reads, such as **fastqc**.

<http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/>

- Delete the PCR primer
  -  先使用BWA软件进行mapping统计，然后再使用samtools rmdup进行去重复）
- Filter the raw reads with low Q-score.

## 从头组装及常用工具

两种组装方式

- *de novo* assembly （从头拼接）
- reference assembly （参考拼接）

面对的问题：

- 不同组装形式有不同的软件工具；
- 不同软件工具适用于不同数据类型；
- 不同软件工具的参数要根据需要作调整；
- 得到大量contigs和scaffolds，留下大大小小的未知区（gaps）。
